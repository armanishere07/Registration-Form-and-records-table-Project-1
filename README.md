# Registration-Form-and-records-table-Project-1
A simple, responsive registration form with a records table made using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. Includes neat input fields, file upload, and edit/delete options. My first web projectâ€”showing a clean look, attention to detail, and my excitement as a beginner learning web design.
